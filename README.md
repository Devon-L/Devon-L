## 👋 Hi, I'm Devon

Infrastructure / DevOps Engineer  
Focus on **production environments**, **virtualization**, **Kubernetes**, and **security operations**.

I work mainly on on-prem infrastructure, system stability, and secure service delivery —  
building things that **run long, stay stable, and fail safely**.
